        <title>How to Create an HTML Page</title>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome!</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">In this website, I have prepared the basics of creating a html file.</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">I hope you will learn all the basic fundementals to creating a html website so you'll be able to create one too.</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">I will cover everything included in the following website. To visit the website, please click  <a href="C:\Users\shen\Desktop\3Q\class9.html" target="_blank"> HERE</a></h3>

        <h2>First let's learn about how I'm even able to type in words in a html file:</h2>
            <p>All elements in a html file are represented by tags (< >). Every element also must have an end tag. The end tag is slightly different then the beginning tag, as you must add a slash in the element.Ex:< p >...< / p >.</p>
            In order to write a paragraph, you will need the paragraph tag, that looks like this:< p >, and a end tag that looks like this:< / p >. In between the tags is where you would write all the info.</p>
            <p>If you want to write a heading for a paragraph, you have many choices. In a html file, your headings come in 6 sizes, one is the biggest, and 6 is the smallest. These elements are represented by tags like so:< h1 >...< / h1 >, < h2 >...< / h2>, and so on and so forth. </p>
            <h3><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b></h3><p>If you type in a heading greater than < h6 >, it will show as if it was a paragraph.</h6></p>
            <h2>Styling Your Website</h2>
            <p>Ever get tired of having a black&white website? Well I'm here to brighten up your website.</p>
            <p>There are many different styles you can use, from colors to font-familys to font-size. </p>
            <p>To do so, you will create your beginning tag but you don't close it. Then you should space and type in style. Next, add in a equal sign and quotes and you should a see a drop box with many different styles. Put in a colon and you should see another dropbox. It should include all your options for your style. After you pick your style, end quote and complete the tag and start typing your information once again.</p>
            <p>Ex:< p style = "background-color:dodgerblue"> ... < / p > </p>
            <h2>Images&Videos</h2>
            <p>Want some images in your website? Well, it's quite simple actually.</p>
            <p>First, you must save your image in a folder. To do so, you right click on your image and click on "save image file". Put the image into a folder and type in the following into your html file in a new line:< img src=</p>
            <p>Then start quotes and type in the name of the folder, slash, and the name of the image and end quote.</p>
            <p>Adding a video to your website is easy. First type in the following in your html file:< a href=. Then copy the link of your video, start quote, paste and end quote. </p>
            <h2>Listings</h2>
            <p>If you want to create a list for something, you'd have to use the list tag, and that's it! All you have to do is start off with < li > and end with < / li > for every line you create.</li></p>
            <p>But there aare also different types of lists you can use. If you want your list to be numbered, you would also have toinclude a ordered list tag, which looks like this: < ol >...< / ol >. You would include all your information you want in your list between the beginning and ending ordered list tag.</p>
            <p>If you don't want your list to be numbered, you should use the unordered list tag, that looks like this:< ul >...< / ul >. Each line in your list would be represented with dots.</p>
            <h2>Tables</h2>
            <p>If your using an html file for some sort of business, you might want to include a table to compare and contrast information. Well here is how to create one. </p>
            <p>First, you must use the table tag to let your computer know you want to create table chart. The table tag looks like this: < table >...< / table >. Next, you have to create rowa for your table. To do so, you must use the table row tag inside your table tag. The table row tag looks like this:< tr >...< / tr >. After you create a row for your table, you should also have columns. To create columns, you must use the table header tag inside your table row tag. The table header tag looks like this:< th >...< / th >. To create multiple columns in one row, just repeat the table header tag on the next line. The information you put in between the table header tag will be shown on your table. To create multiple rows, just repeat the table row and header process on the next line.</p>
            <p>Ex:</p>
                <p>< table ></p>
                <p>_____< tr ></p>
                <p>___________< th >Random Title That I'm too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>
                <p>___________< th >Random Title That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>
                <p>___________< th >Random Title That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>
                <p>_____< / tr ></p>
                <p>_____< tr ></p>
                <p>___________< th >Random Data That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>                 
                <p>___________< th >Random Data That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>             
                <p>___________< th >Random Data That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>                
                <p>_____< / tr ></p>
                <p>_____< tr ></p>
                <p>___________< th >Random Data That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>                 
                <p>___________< th >Random Data That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>              
                <p>___________< th >Random Data That I'm Too Lazy to Think of< / th ></p>                
                <p>_____< / tr ></p>
            <p>    < / table ></p>
            <p>That was the coding for my table. On the website, the table should look like this:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Random Title That I'm Too Lazy to Think of</th>
                    <th>Random Title That I'm Too Lazy to Think of</th>
                    <th>Random Title That I'm Too Lazy to Think of</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Random Data That I'm too Lazy to Think of</td>
                    <td>Random Data That I'm too Lazy to Think of</td>
                    <td>Random Data That I'm too Lazy to Think of</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Random Data That I'm too Lazy to Think of</td>
                    <td>Random Data That I'm too Lazy to Think of</td>
                    <td>Random Data That I'm too Lazy to Think of</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>That is what a table should look like without any styling. Styling tables will not be covered in this website. How to Create a HTML File part two will be coming out shortly.</p>
            <h3> I hope you guys were able to learn smething from this website. Part 2 will be more advanced so stick around for that. But until then...</h3>
